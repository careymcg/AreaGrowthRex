  #Use a 4th year if it's the first partial assessment year; the 4th year is the final catch for the previous year. Wrote this line after a conversation with Grant
  #I actually don't think a 4th year is necessary, but it doesn't matter or hurt for the exec summary table
  #This is an old line (?): Still need to do 1 year projections for status determination with just current yr-1 and current yr specified.
